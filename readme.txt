Students Information System is a web application developed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), PHP and MySQL. You need the following softwares installed on your system to run this application:-

i) Apache Web Server (version 2.4.23 or above)
ii) PHP (version 5.6 or above)
iii) MySQL (version 5.7.14 or above)

I have exported the MySQL database named studentsdatabase to the file named studentsdatabase.sql
To import this database in your local MySQL server, first create a new database and then import the file studentsdatabase.sql

Once you have got the database ready, please update the configdatabase.php file to provide your local MySQL server settings, such as MySQL host machine name, database name, user name and password.

To run this web application on your local machine, you can copy this folder to your Apache web server's root directory. And then, open it in your web browser using http://localhost/studentsystem 

I have uploaded this web application to a web server as well, so that you can see it working online.
So, you can visit http://lifestreet.fast-page.org/studentsystem
